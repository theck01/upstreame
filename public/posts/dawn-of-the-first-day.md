So. Videogames. 

If you squint and turn your head sideways, they’re like movies that don’t happen until you make them. 
We think there’s probably more to it than that, but the explanations always tend to blur at the edges. 

Consider this: someone recently made [The Last Of Us](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/the-last-of-us) 
into [a 6 hour ‘movie’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkLPKd-Vs8g) by recording in-game cinematics and rushing through 
player-controlled segments. 
It currently has *1.6 million views,* but something about it feels very wrong. There’s something lost in the transition, 
like a sock puppet rendition of To Kill A Mockingbird. Or a Leo Da Vinci paint by numbers. It’s missing what makes a game a game, 
and anyone who’s played it can attest.  
Even a flash game like [Freedom Bridge](http://www.necessarygames.com/my-games/freedom-bridge/flash), with it's simple visuals 
and unclear goal, can speak louder to its audience than any visual, and it’s hard to explain *why.*

It's nearly intangible- the special sauce between the DVR's 'Play' button and a well-worn joypad- but 
we believe there’s something to be said about the medium as a whole. Something *human.* And it's not going away.

The merits of gaming have been discussed before. The internet is abuzz with commentary and 'game journalism,' 
and we, the audience, are no stranger to the [impact videogames can have on our lives]
(http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/119110-for-sarah/). 
Even pop-culture icons Gabe and Tycho of [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/10/18/tall-grass-big-stakes) 
have lamented the [bad rap that games get from older generations,](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art) 
standing behind them as [imaginative tools](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2014/06/30/quantification) for learning and growth.

But through all the dialogue, it seems like we're forgetting what story-telling used to mean. 
That games like To The Moon and Limbo and even God of War might just be important *because* of their 
similarities to ‘how things used to be done,’ not in spite of them.

See, my great-uncle had this thing where he'd work one of us kids into every story he told. 
It was cool. Whether I was the outlaw or the constable, I *loved* when it was my turn, because it reminded me of the 
days before phone lines and traffic, when a man could sit around the fire, and every story he told wrapped 
around the listeners like a web. I pictured them with peacepipes and harmonicas, doing what humans do- talking 
about their lives, telling their story. 
And it always reminded me of Link, too, saving Termina with the player’s help- it was a story *I* was a part of. 
It was uncanny. 

There's something *old* about being a part of a story. Something fantastic. It’s in the 
[memetic code.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMemetics&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGN5zHu6Ed5TSFKp-oCRllk9PefPQ) 
It's the same reason those Choose Your Own Adventure books are so damn fun. It's why we vote on American Idol and 
campaign for Ron Paul (literally the only reason). We all just want to be a part of the story. And sometimes, 
through all of the voices out there, it's hard to do that.

So we decided to make our own.

We've got a game in the works. It's about voices. And choices. And things coming to an end. One part 
[Limbo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TqqDvfvxd8&t=2m24s) and one part [Braid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WNwVmWuyjo&t=2m36s), 
a splash of [Kentucky Route Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_pgxP7zdPA), and, *like all good things,* just a little bit 
Lunar Lander. 

We want it to be real. Not through shock value or sympathy grabs, but through tone and resonance and interaction. 
An exploration of what matters in a way that couldn’t be done without player involvement.

So stay tuned folks, we’re hoping things get interesting.
